            <span class="whydoupper-caption">Cancer arises from genetic changes (mutations) that occur during the child's early development, often before birth. These mutations can disrupt the normal control mechanisms that regulate cell growth and division, leading to the development of cancer. Some factors that may contribute to the development of childhood cancer include:</span>

            <span class="whydobottom-container-heading">Genetic predisposition</span>
            <span class="whydobottom-container-content">Certain genetic conditions or inherited gene mutations can increase a child's risk of developing cancer. Examples include neurofibromatosis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, retinoblastoma gene mutations, and others.</span>

            <span class="whydobottom-container-heading">Environmental factors</span>
            <span class="whydobottom-container-content">Exposure to certain environmental factors, such as radiation and certain chemicals, may increase the risk of childhood cancer. However, these factors are relatively rare causes of pediatric cancer compared to genetic factors.

            <span class="whydobottom-container-content">In many cases, the exact cause of childhood cancer remains unknown. It is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to the development of cancer in children.</span>

            <span class="whydobottom-container-heading">Things to remember</span>
            <span class="whydobottom-container-content">It's important to note that most children who develop cancer do not have any known risk factors, and the vast majority of children with risk factors do not develop cancer. Childhood cancer is still considered relatively rare, and the majority of childhood cancers occur sporadically without a clear explanation.Research is ongoing to better understand the causes of childhood cancer and to develop strategies for prevention and earlyÂ detection.
