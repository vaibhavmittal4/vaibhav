            <span class="finding-cancer-grid-rightspan">1. Signs and Symptoms: Many childhood cancers have specific signs and symptoms that may differ from those seen in adults. These can include unexplained weight loss, persistent pain, lumps or swelling, unusual bleeding or bruising, frequent infections, and changes in vision or eye appearance. </span>
            <span class="finding-cancer-grid-rightspan">2. Medical Evaluation: When a child presents with symptoms that raise suspicion of cancer, a thorough medical evaluation is conducted. This typically involves a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to assess blood counts, organ function, and other relevant parameters.</span>

Biopsies, where a small sample of tissue is collected for examination, are also crucial in diagnosing cancer and determining its type and characteristics.</span>
